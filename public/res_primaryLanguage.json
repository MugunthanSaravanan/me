      "description": "Wildlife monitoring and animal detection are essential for effective environmental management and conservation. Traditional methods for identifying animals, particularly in real-time, are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient. This project tackles these limitations by developing a robust, real-time animal detection system utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. By employing deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLO (Y ou Only Look Once), the system accurately detects and classifies multiple animal species in camera feeds with high precision. It can identify discrepancies between detected animal counts and user-defined expectations, triggering automatic alerts via Twilioâ€™s SMS service for immediate action. Secure data storage on Firebase enables personalized monitoring and historical tracking, and advanced image preprocessing techniques enhance the systemâ€™s performance under variable environmental conditions such as lighting changes or background noise. Through this integration of deep learning, real-time alerting, and cloud-based data storage, the solution boosts the efficiency of wildlife monitoring, supports conservation efforts, and provides actionable insights for researchers and environmental agencies. Additionally, the system offers potential applications in preventing illegal poaching by enabling real-time surveillance and rapid response capabilities.",
